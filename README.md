# py-mcelreath
As a pedagogical exercise, here we generate our own Python library and script translations of the
R in the second edition of 'Statistical Rethinking' by Richard McElreath (see [here](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/).

I'll try to avoid using too many unfamiliar (to me) libraries such as PyMC, to ensure I understand
what they're doing. Focus will be on clean and well-documented code without too much magic. The
original R code can be found [here](http://xcelab.net/rmpubs/sr2/code.txt).

The project structure is inspired by cookiecutter-ds and
https://github.com/cthoyt/cookiecutter-snekpack, and faintly by DS from scratch by Joel Grus.

Side note: this book is superbly written.

Other side note: once I've finished all the exercises and notebooks I'll look at [the official PyMC
port](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc-resources/tree/main/Rethinking) which will demonstrate how
the pros do it.
