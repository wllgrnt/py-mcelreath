# py-mcelreath
As a pedagogical exercise, here we generate our own Python library and script translations of the
R in the second edition of 'Statistical Rethinking' by Richard McElreath (see [here](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/).

I'll try to avoid using too many unfamiliar (to me) libraries such as PyMC, to ensure I understand
what they're doing. Focus will be on clean and well-documented code without too much magic.
